      The <strong>Aineta aryballos</strong> is an Ancient <em>Greek aryballos</em> (a small, spherical flask or vase), made between <mark>approximately</mark> 625 and 570 BCE in the city of Corinth in southern Greece. Approximately 6.35 centimetres (2.50 in) in both height and diameter, it was intended to contain perfumed oil or unguent, and is likely to have been owned by a high-class courtesan (hetaira) by the name of Aineta.

    <p><h4>China’s Zhang Weili has made a habit of defying the odds. The current Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) mixed martial arts star fought her way out of a hardscrabble life in the northern Chinese mining center of Handan to win the women’s strawweight division world title, then she lost it, and then she fought her way back to the top by winning it once again.

      Along the way, the 35-year-old has become an icon in her homeland and beyond, with millions of fans drawn to her all-action style in the MMA cage, lucrative commercial deals with the likes of Estée Lauder, and the wealth that comes with a world championship, and – in total, across two stints as champion – four title defences.</h4></p>

    <p><h5>Ryan Coogler is expressing his “eternal gratitude” following the successful box office debut of his latest movie, Sinners.

      The filmmaker penned an emotional letter to those who went to the theater this past week to watch the film, starring Michael B. Jordan. The horror pic follows twin brothers who return to their hometown to start again, trying to leave their troubled lives behind, only to discover that an even greater evil is waiting to welcome them back.
      
      “Eternal gratitude. My heart is bursting with it,” Coogler’s letter read. “I want to thank each and every one of you who bought a ticket to see Sinners. Who decided to drive to see the film in different formats. Who bought popcorn and a drink, booked a sitter and carpooled, and stood in the lobby afterward and talked and made a friend. Who changed their work schedules. Who saw the film in groups.”</h5></p>

      <p>Water is commonly represented by the chemical formula H<sub>2</sub>O, where the subscript "2" indicates that each molecule contains two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom. In mathematics, expressions like x<sup>2</sup> are used to denote powers, with the superscript "2" meaning that the variable x is raised to the second power, or squared. Both subscript and superscript notations are essential in scientific and mathematical contexts for conveying precise information.</p>
